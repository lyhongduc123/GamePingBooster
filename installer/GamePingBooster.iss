; Game Ping Booster installer (Inno Setup 6)
;
; Build it with:   .\gpb.ps1 installer      (or ./gpb installer from Git Bash)
; That publishes the Native AOT binaries first, because this script only packages what is
; already built and will refuse to run if they are missing.
;
; Why Inno Setup and not WiX: WiX v7 refuses to run until its Open Source Maintenance Fee EULA
; is accepted, which is a licensing commitment for a commercial product. Inno Setup is free for
; commercial use with nothing to sign. The trade is that this produces a .exe rather than an
; .msi - which costs nothing here, since nobody deploys a game utility by Group Policy.
;
; The four things this has to get right, in order of how badly they fail when wrong:
;
;   1. Stop the service BEFORE copying files. It runs as LocalSystem and holds gpb-service.exe
;      and wintun.dll open; a copy over a running service fails with a locked-file error that
;      names neither.
;   2. Register the service as LocalSystem. Administrator is not enough for Wintun - it returns
;      ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5) and the tunnel never comes up.
;   3. Install the Wintun driver during setup, not on the user's first Connect. Otherwise their
;      first impression is a pause and a driver notification from Windows.
;   4. Remove the service on uninstall. A leftover service that points at deleted files sits in
;      the machine forever and cannot be removed from the UI.

#define AppName        "Game Ping Booster"

; The version comes from ..\VERSION, the one place the whole product agrees on it, and
; `gpb.ps1 installer` passes it in with /DAppVersion. This used to be a hand-written "0.1.0"
; here and nothing else in the tree said anything at all, so every binary shipped as 1.0.0 - the
; MSBuild default - inside a setup .exe that called itself something different.
;
; #ifndef, not a bare #define: a #define here would overwrite whatever /D put in, which is the
; quiet way for a command-line version to be accepted and then ignored. The fallback is for
; running ISCC directly on this file, where nothing passes it.
#ifndef AppVersion
  #define AppVersion "0.0.0-dev"
#endif

; The same version with any pre-release suffix removed. Windows version resources are four
; numbers and nothing else, so "1.0.0-beta1" cannot go in one - Inno refuses to compile. The
; suffix stays in AppVersion, which is free text and is what the user actually reads.

; The WHOLE publish output of each project, not a hand-written list of executables.
;
; The first version named GamePingBooster.exe and gpb-service.exe explicitly, and produced an
; installer that put a working .exe on a clean machine where it crashed instantly. Native AOT
; still leaves native satellites beside the binary - libSkiaSharp.dll is Avalonia's renderer,
; libHarfBuzzSharp.dll shapes text, av_libglesv2.dll is ANGLE - and none of them were copied.
; The crash was a TypeInitializationException inside SkiaPlatform.Initialize, which names
; neither a missing file nor the installer, and it could not be reproduced on the build machine
; because all three DLLs were already sitting in the publish folder there.
;
; Globbing is not laziness, it is the fix: a dependency added later comes along on its own
; instead of going missing and failing at run time on somebody else's PC.

; The profile is content: the game's address ranges. It is read relative to the install
; directory, which is why ServiceConfig's profilePath default is a relative path and why nothing
; here writes an absolute one - an absolute path only works on the machine it was written on.
; One file per game, so a game is added by shipping its file here and nothing else. Self-hosted:
; the service loads every *.json beside the configured one. Licensed: the pushed, sealed profiles
; are the only source of ranges, and a shipped file is merged too ONLY if it declares no ranges
; and no relays - see TunnelEngine.LoadProfileAsync. That is what lets Minecraft ship here, since
; a game-only file is the whole of what it has to contribute.

; The service writes its configuration and logs here, as LocalSystem. Nothing is placed in it at
; install time: there is no key to write, and the user sets the relay from the app's settings
; screen once it starts.
;
; GamePingBooster, NOT {#AppName}. The display name has spaces in it and the data directory does
; not - ServiceConfig.DefaultDirectory is Combine(CommonApplicationData, "GamePingBooster"). This
; used to say {#AppName}, so setup created an empty "Game Ping Booster" folder that nothing ever
; opened, while the folder the service actually uses was created at run time by whichever code
; path got there first. Nothing broke, which is why it survived; it just meant the installer was
; not doing the one thing this section is here for.
