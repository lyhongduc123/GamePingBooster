/// <summary>
/// The bridge between the UI (normal user rights) and the engine (LocalSystem).
///
/// Model: every message is one line of JSON. The UI sends commands, the service replies with
/// state, and the service also pushes state whenever something changes (game start/stop, ping
/// updates, connection loss).
///
/// Security: the pipe ACL only grants the local Users group read/write. The service accepts no
/// file paths and no arbitrary commands from the UI - a fixed set of verbs, with every
/// parameter checked here rather than in the UI. This is a privilege boundary; keep it narrow.
///
/// Two of them carry a SECRET, and both are write-only: set-relay takes the pre-shared key,
/// set-token takes the licence token. Nothing ever sends either back up. Anything readable over
/// this pipe is readable by every process running as the user, which is the whole reason the
/// status message reports that a token EXISTS and when it expires, and never what it is.
